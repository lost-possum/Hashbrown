# Hashbrown v0.01

***

This is a simple Python script that leverages the hashlib Python library to provide hash outputs for any type of file. 

Currently, this program supports the following hash algorithms: 

* MD4
* MD5
* SHA1
* SHA224
* SHA256
* SHA385
* SHA512
* SHA3_224
* SHA3_256
* SHA3_384
* SHA3_512
* Blake2B
* Blake2S
* Shake_256
* RIPEMD160
* Whirlpool 

***

I plan to add support for both symmetric and assymetric encryption, including:

* GPG keypairs
* SSH keypairs
* Veracrypt-compatible keyfiles
* Wireguard keypairs
